# 🧪 Mixed-Messages

### Description

> This is my first portfolio project on Codecademy.  
> The goal is to build a **random message generator**: every time you run the program, you get a different result.  
> In this case, the program randomly selects a **name** and combines it with a **fixed message** to produce a fun or surprising output.
